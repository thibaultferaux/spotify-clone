## Overview

This is a basic clone of Spotify with some music playing functionality.

I made some projects in [React](https://reactjs.org/) before but never with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) so I wanted to try this out on a project. I also didn't want to make a simple project like a basic website so I decided to make a Spotify clone.
